# StudyBuddy-ai

An AI-powered vocabulary learning application built with **Go**, **React**, and **Google Gemini**.

StudyBuddy helps students reinforce vocabulary through dynamically generated multiple-choice quizzes. Users provide a custom list of vocabulary words, and the application generates contextual sentences using Gemini AI, creating an interactive fill-in-the-blank learning experience.

## Technical Highlights

### AI Integration

- Integrated Google Gemini API to generate contextual vocabulary questions dynamically
- Designed prompt generation and response parsing workflows
- Managed external API communication and error handling

### Session-Based Quiz State

- Implemented cookie-based session management in Go
- Maintained quiz progress across multiple requests
- Stored user state without requiring authentication

### Backend API Design

- Built RESTful endpoints using the Gin framework
- Separated handlers, models, and business logic into distinct layers
- Implemented JSON request/response patterns for frontend integration

### Containerized Deployment

- Dockerized frontend and backend services
- Configured Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Orchestrated multi-container deployment with Docker Compose

### Frontend-Backend Communication

- React frontend communicates with Go API through Axios
- Managed asynchronous quiz workflows and state updates
- Implemented dynamic question loading and answer validation

    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Gemini

    User->>Frontend: Enter 10 vocabulary words
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/start

    Backend->>Gemini: Generate sentence
    Gemini-->>Backend: Context sentence

    Backend-->>Frontend: Question + options

    User->>Frontend: Select answer
    Frontend->>Backend: POST /api/check

    Backend-->>Frontend: Correct / Incorrect

    loop Remaining Questions
        Frontend->>Backend: GET next question
        Backend->>Gemini: Generate sentence
        Gemini-->>Backend: Sentence
        Backend-->>Frontend: New question
    end
